This is the beginning of a story where I will create branches and use them to track alternatives as a way to learn about branching. The sequence of events will be numbered,
which will allow me to better visualize changes that happen.

1. Little red riding hood gets a basket from her mom for her grandmother.
2. Mother instructs her to go straight to Grandmother's. Red leaves.
3. Red goes into forest until mothers goes inside, and then returns home, plays quietly in woods, eats goodie basket herself.
4. After a long day of playing, she comes inside and lies to her mothers, saying her grandmother loved the basket.
5. A week later, her mother visits grandmother, finds out about the lie, and Red gets whipped.
6. She turns out to be a pathological liar. Instead of learning not to lie, she learns to lie better. And becomes a lawyer.
