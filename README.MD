This is the beginning of a story where I will create branches and use them to track alternatives as a way to learn about branching. The sequence of events will be numbered,

1. Little red riding hood gets a basket from her mom for her grandmother.
2. Mother instructs her to go straight to Grandmother's. Red leaves.
