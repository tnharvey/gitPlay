This is the beginning of a story where I will create branches and use them to track alternatives as a way to learn about branching. The sequence of events will be numbered,
which will allow me to better visualize changes that happen.

1. Little red riding hood gets a basket from her mom for her grandmother.
2. Mother instructs her to go straight to Grandmother's. Red leaves.
3. Red walks through the forest and encounters the wolf. He asks for a taste of the treats.
4. Red says, "NO." and runs to her Grandmas.
5. While she was running to grandma's, Red runs into her uncle, on his way back from visiting grandma.
6. He asks, "What's wrong Red, why are you running?" She says it was just for exercise, says, "Bye!" and keeps running.
7. When she arrives at grandma's the wolf is waiting in disguise as her grandma, having eaten her grandmother.
8. Red doesn't realize it, asks stupid questions, and gets eaten.
The End.
