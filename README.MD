This is the beginning of a story where I will create branches and use them to track alternatives as a way to learn about branching. The sequence of events will be numbered,
which will allow me to better visualize changes that happen.

1. Little red riding hood gets a basket from her mom for her grandmother.
2. Mother instructs her to go straight to Grandmother's. Red leaves.
3. Red goes into forest until mothers goes inside, and then returns home, plays quietly in woods, eats goodie basket herself.
4. After a long day of playing, she comes inside and lies to her mothers, saying her grandmother loved the basket.
5. A week later, her mother goes to visit grandmother and found out she died the day after Red was supposed to visit.
6. While her mother never finds out about the lie, Red lives with the guilt of knowing she should have been there the day before.
7. She never lies again, and her intense honesty leads her to be a nun.
