This is the beginning of a story where I will create branches and use them to track alternatives as a way to learn about branching. The sequence of events will be numbered,
which will allow me to better visualize changes that happen.

1. Little red riding hood gets a basket from her mom for her grandmother.
2. Mother instructs her to go straight to Grandmother's. Red leaves.
3. Red goes into forest until mothers goes inside, and then returns home, plays quietly in woods, eats goodie basket herself.
4. While Red plays, a visitor arrives, Red's uncle, who just came from visiting grandmother. He didn't see Red there, and now her mother is worried.
5. After a long day of playing, she comes inside and lies to her mothers, saying her grandmother loved the basket.
6. Red's mother is livid at Red's bald-faced lie, and Red gets whipped and grounded for a month.
7. Red tries lying again later, but her Uncle always seems to show up and get her busted. She eventually gives up and turns out somewhat normal.
