This is the beginning of a story where I will create branches and use them to track alternatives as a way to learn about branching. The sequence of events will be numbered,
which will allow me to better visualize changes that happen.

1. Little red riding hood gets a basket from her mom for her grandmother.
2. Mother instructs her to go straight to Grandmother's. Red leaves.
3. Red walks through the forest and encounters the wolf. He asks for a taste of the treats.
4. Red says, "NO." and runs to her Grandmas.
5. On the way, Red runs into her uncle, on his way back from visiting grandma.
6. Red tells him about the wolf, and he says he'll find the wolf and "take care of him".
7. The uncle finds th wolf's tracks, and hunts him all the way back to grandma's, where he catches him about to eat gradma.
8. The uncle kills the wolf, and Red, Grandma, and Uncle all enjoy the treat basket, thankful to be alive and well.
The End.
